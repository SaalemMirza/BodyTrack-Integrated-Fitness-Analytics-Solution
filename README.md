Welcome to the Gym-Management-System (DBMS project) repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for managing gym operations efficiently, leveraging data modeling, data warehousing, and data visualization techniques. Below, you'll find an overview of the project's key components and methodologies:

Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):
The project includes a meticulously designed ERD that illustrates the relationships between different entities in the gym management system. Entities such as Customer, Membership, Payment, Trainer, Schedule, and more are interconnected through well-defined relationships, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

Physical Table Diagram:
In addition to the ERD, a physical table diagram has been created to provide a detailed representation of the database schema. This diagram outlines the structure of each table, including attributes, data types, primary and foreign keys, and constraints.

Both these diagrams can be found in Project Description docx file.

Database Implementation on PostgreSQL:
The ERD and physical table diagrams serve as blueprints for implementing the gym management system database on PostgreSQL. Through detailed database design and schema normalization, the database ensures efficient data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.

Data Visualization:
Utilizing the power of Tableau Desktop, visually appealing and interactive dashboards have been created to extract insights from the gym management system database. These dashboards provide detailed analytics on various aspects such as BMI distribution, revenue comparison between previous and current weeks, revenue distribution by days of the week, gender-wise metrics, top customers based on weight, and revenue analysis for each tender year.

Integration with Postgres Database:
Seamless integration between Tableau and the PostgreSQL database enables real-time querying and visualization of gym management system data. This integration ensures that dashboards reflect the latest information, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions based on up-to-date insights.

Repository Structure:
ERD and Physical Table Diagrams: Contains visual representations of the database schema.
SQL Scripts: Includes SQL scripts for database creation and schema definition
Tableau Dashboards: Stores Tableau workbook files (.twb) containing the interactive dashboards created for data visualization.
README.md: You're currently reading it! This file serves as the project's main documentation, providing an overview of its components and methodologies.
